🔌 API Integration
The frontend expects a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/contacts	Fetch all contacts
POST	/contacts	Add a new contact
PUT	/contacts/:id	Update contact by ID
DELETE	/contacts/:id	Delete contact by ID

You can plug in your own backend (e.g., Spring Boot, Node.js Express, or Firebase).

Let me know if:
- You're using a specific backend (like Spring Boot or Firebase) so I can tailor the API details.
- You want to add instructions for backend setup too.
- You want badge icons, screenshots, or a dark-mode toggle info section.

Would you like a GitHub-friendly version with badges and deploy links too?
